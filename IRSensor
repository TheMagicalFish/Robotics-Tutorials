//This program will introduce you to the basics of HiTechnic Infrared Sensor. (HTIRS2)
//To see it in action, attach an HTIRS2 sensor to the S2 port of your NXT brick.

//The infrared sensor reads values from 0 to 9.
//A reading of 0 means that the sensor detects no infrared beacon.
//Readings from 1 to 9 mean that a beacon is detected. 1 is far left, 5 is directly in front, and 9 is far right.
//Beginning from about the 8 o'clock position, the ranges alternate between 60 and 5 degrees.

//This program will play rising notes when a beacon is to the left,
//play falling notes when the beacon is to the right,
//play a blip when it is directly in front,
//and play a 'beep beep!' when it reads nothing.

//It will repeat every 2 seconds.

task main() {
	//For the sake of consistency during the loop, we will use a storage variable to ensure that the sensor value is the same during the loop.

	int position = 0;

	while(true) { //Infinite loop

		position = SensorValue(IRSensor); //This stores the current value of the sensor in the variable 'position'.

		if(position == 0) { //If no beacon is detected
			PlaySound(soundBeepBeep);
		}

		else { //If the beacon is detected
			if(position < 5) { //If the beacon is to the left of the sensor
				PlaySound(soundUpwardTones);
			}
			if(position == 5) { //If the beacon is directly in front of the sensor
				PlaySound(soundBlip);
			}
			if(position > 5) { //If the beacon is to the right of the sensor
				PlaySound(soundDownwardTones);
			}
		}
	}
}

//This information will help you to create fairly accurate infrared programs. For higher accuracy, traded with much higher complexity,
//you will have to work with harder systems. Look at
