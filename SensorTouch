//This code will introduce you to the NXT Mindstorms touch sensor.
//To see it in action, attach a touch sensor to the S2 port of your NXT brick.

//The touch sensor is very simple. It reads two values: 0 and 1.
//0 is returned when the sensor is not activated, and 1 is returned when the sensor is activated.

//The following program will go through an infinite loop, and make the robot "Beep!" when the sensor is activated, or "Boop!" when it is not activated.

task main()
{
	while(true) { //Infinite loop
		if(SensorValue(touchSensor) == 1) { //If the sensor is activated
			PlaySound(soundBeepBeep);
		}

		if(SensorValue(touchSensor) == 0) { //If the sensor is not activated
			PlaySound(soundBlip);
		}
	}
}

//That is literally everything you need to know.
