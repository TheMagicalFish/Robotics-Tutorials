//This code will introduce you to the button interface of the NXT brick.
//Because it is very simple, it will also give you some basic sample code for a user interface.
//To use this code, you simply need to download it to your NXT brick.

//The NXT brick only has 4 buttons: Buttons 0-3.
//Button 0 is the grey rectangle button.
//Button 1 is the right arrow button.
//Button 2 is the left arrow button.
//Button 3 is the orange square button.

//To read the current button being pressed, we use the function nNxtButtonPressed.
//It also returns -1 if no button is pressed.

//The following is sample code for a basic user interface using the nNxtButtonPressed function.
//It will display the current number of the button being pressed, provided that a button is currently pressed.

task main()
{
	nxtDisplayCenteredTextLine(1, "Press a Button.");

	while(true) { //Infinite Loop
		if(nNxtButtonPressed != -1) { //If a button is being pressed
			nxtDisplayCenteredTextLine(4, "%d", nNxtButtonPressed); //Displays the current button being pressed
		}
		else { //If no button is being pressed
			nxtDisplayClearTextLine(4); //Clear the line so that no button is displayed.
		}
	}
}

//This is all you need to know in order to make some clever initialization code for your autonomous period.
