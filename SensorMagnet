//*!!Code automatically generated by 'ROBOTC' configuration wizard               !!*//

//This code will introduce you to the basics of the HiTechnic Magnetic Sensor.
//To see it in action, attach a HiTechnic  Magnetic Field Sensor to the S2 port of your NXT Brick.

//The magnet sensor reads the strength of vertical magnetic fields that flow through it.
//It gives values ranging from -255 to 255. +/- tells us the position of the magnet, and 0-255 tells us the strength of the field.
//255 is maximum strength, with the positive end facing up.
//0 occurs when no vertical magnetic field is detected.
//-255 is maximum strength, with the negative end facing up.

//It is important to note that this sensor will not find a magnet if its poles are horizonatal, because a horizontal field will not be detected.
//Thus, the further from vertical a magnet is rotated, the lower the strength will be.

//In addition, the strength of a magnetic field decreases as the distance from the magnet decreases.
//Thus, the further away from the sensor the magnet is, the lower the strength will be.
//Previous testing implies that this sensor will only notice magnets that are less than 4cm away.

//This code will display the magnet sensor's return value on the NXT brick, and will be updated live.

task main()
{
	while(true) {
		int magnetStrength = SensorValue(magnetSensor); //Stores the sensor value in the integer magnetStrength
		//It is not necessary to store this variable, but for the sake of clarity, it is separated.

		nxtDisplayCenteredTextLine(4, "%d", magnetStrength); //Displays the sensor value on the NXT Brick
