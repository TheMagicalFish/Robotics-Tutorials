//*!!Code automatically generated by 'ROBOTC' configuration wizard               !!*//

//This code will introduce you to the NXT light sensor.
//To see it in action, attach a light sensor to the S2 port of your NXT brick.

//The light sensor reads values from 0 to 100, increasing as the surface measured gets brighter.
//In general, it should be held against the surface for best results.

//The following program will play a sound if the surface it is held against is darker than a neutral grey (Light Value 50).

task main()
{
	while(true) { //Infinite loop

		if(SensorValue(lightSensor) < 50) { //If the sensor registers a surface darker than neutral grey
			PlaySound(soundBlip);
		}
		wait1Msec(100);
	}
	//If you want to detect a specific color, say blue or red, I recommend giving a margin of error of at least 10.
	//And yes, colors can be detected. This sensor just runs in greyscale.
}
//That should be all you need to know.
